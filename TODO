Step 1:
    ✔ Create folders @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ scss @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ css @done(22-11-04 10:19)
    ✔ Create Sub-folders in scss folder @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ base @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ component @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ utilities @done(22-11-04 10:19)
Step 2:
    ✔ change "normalize.css" to a sass partial and move it to base folder @done(22-11-04 10:19)
    ✔ create index fil in the base folder @done(22-11-04 10:19)

    ✔ in component file create the following sass partial files @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ navigation @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ grid @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ form @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ button @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ index @done(22-11-04 10:19)
    ✔ in utilities file create the following sass partial files @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ variables @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ mixins @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ index @done(22-11-04 10:19)
    ✔ Create "styles.scss" in the scss folder @done(22-11-04 10:19)
        ✔ import all index partials into the "styles.scss" file @done(22-11-04 10:19)
Step 3:
    ✔ Enable "watch" for changes and proper "style.css" and "style.css.map" file generation @done(22-11-04 10:19)
Step 4:
    ✔ Create at lease 5 color variables @done(22-11-07 11:03)
    ☐ create a variable that stores the size of the media query breakpoint
Step 5:
    ☐ add styles to typography partial
        ☐ look for:
            ☐ font-family
            ☐ size
            ☐ weight
        ☐ pay attention to tags:
            ✔ a @done(22-11-07 11:06)
            ☐ h1
            ☐ body
            ✔ * (universal selector) @done(22-11-07 11:06)
Step 6:
    ☐ add styles to components partial
        ✔ Transfer remaining CSS into their respective components. For example, any class selectors that begin with grid, column, or rows could go in the grid component. @done(22-11-07 11:04)
        ☐ update any styles that use color values with sass variables you created in the previous step
Extra Credit:
    ☐ Use a nested selector structure for at least one component
        ☐ create a base selector for a group of related styles.
        ☐ Inside of that selector, use the Sass parent selector: & to append a child class selector to the base. An example would be in the navigation component use .nav as the base selector, annd nest .nav-link inside of it.
    ☐ Use built in Sass function to add hover effect.
        ☐ created a hover effect for buttons
        ☐ for the effect, lighten the button's background color by 15%
        ☐ add a css transition so that the color change fades in.
    ☐ Add dark mode
    ☐ Add favicon
    ☐ README file
Step 7:
    ☐ compare project to "How you will be graded" rubric
    ☐ post in #review-my-project channel
    ☐ Submit for grade
